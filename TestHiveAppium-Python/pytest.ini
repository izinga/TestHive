[pytest]
# This section defines custom markers that you can use to categorize your tests.
# For example, you can mark a test with @pytest.mark.smoke and then run only
# the smoke tests using the command: pytest -m smoke
markers =
    smoke: marks tests as smoke tests (for a quick sanity check)
    regression: marks tests as regression tests (for a full test suite run)
    login: marks tests related to the login feature
    products: marks tests related to the products page
    cart: marks tests related to the shopping cart
    checkout: marks tests related to the checkout flow

# This section sets default command-line options that will be used every time
# you run pytest, so you don't have to type them manually.
addopts =
    -v
    -ra
    --strict-markers

# -v: Verbose mode, shows more details for each test.
# -ra: Shows a short summary for all test outcomes (pass, fail, skip, etc.).
# --strict-markers: Fails the test run if you use a marker that isn't registered here.
